# Dynamic Time Clock

Welcome to the Dynamic Time Clock repository! Here, you'll find a sleek and minimalist implementation of a dynamic clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This clock boasts three circular indicators for hours, minutes, and seconds, each uniquely styled with vibrant colors and animated dots. We've also incorporated the elegant Poppins font from Google Fonts to enhance the design further.

## Features

- **Real-Time Updates:** Experience the magic of real-time updates as the clock seamlessly reflects the current time.

- **Circular Indicators:** Each time indicator is elegantly represented by a circular SVG element, offering a visually pleasing and interactive user experience.
- **Color Customization:** Personalize your clock by customizing the color of each circular indicator to match your style and preferences.
